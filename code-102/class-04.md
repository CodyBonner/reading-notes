# Structure Web Pages with HTML

This portion of the site will be used to go into more detail of site creation with the main topics being Wireframe and Design as well as Mozilla HTML Basics.

## Wireframe and Design

**First things first, what is a wireframe?**

To put it simply wireframing is a practice that's often used by UX designers, allowing them to sort and plan out the hierarchy of information they intend to use to design a website, app, or product for consumer use. It's a way for the designer or in a business sense a client to plan out how they want the end user to view, obtain and process information from the site. Typically this is done after receiving user research from a UX design team.

To elaborate a bit more plainly. If you're creating a website, it'd be pretty important to have an idea of where you want certain information to go and whether or not it comes before or after a specific portion of information. However wireframing is also used to help determine how the end user will use and navigate the website like with button, hyperlink placements, and drop down menu's.

When it comes to developing a website or anything else end user dependent, it's best to take a look at it from the side of the end user. To put it simply, if the end user can't navigate it in black and white on paper, no amount of fancy texts, colors or extra coding on the developer's side will make the website, app or process anymore user friendly.

### HTML Basics

**What is HTML and why do we use it?**

Using similar language we've seen before instead of using Markdown like we have been with git, HTML is a Markup language typically used to help structure content for website use. It uses a series of elements to enclose, or wrap around different parts of content to make it appear or act a certain way. Tags will be used pretty frequently so to summarize their use, they are capable of making a word or an image hyperlink to somehwere else whether that be to another site, or another portion of the site it's attached to.

**What are the three main parts of an HTML element?**

A typical element will generall have an *opening tag* + *enclosed text context* + *closing tag*, something to remember is that elements and tags are not the same thing. Tags will typically be at the beginning or end of an element, however elements are part of the DOM or the document model for displaying the page in the browser.

**What is it called when you give an element extra information?**

When you want to give an element extra information that you don't want to appear in the actual content, we give the element something called an attribute. For example *<p class="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>*, class is the attribute name and editor-note is that attributes value. It allows for for a non unique identifier to this element.

**Semantics**

Well what are semantics? 

From a developers perspective, semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code. Example: what effect does running that line of javascript have?, or what purpose does that HTML element have?

To put it more bluntly, semantics are the functions of specific code. In javascript, build('Peach') might reference the building of something with the unique identifier Peach, in HTML the h1 element being placed on both sides of text such as "h1 This is a top heading h1" will turn the text inside into a header.

Understanding every part of creating a website is vital to it's success. From the planning it out on pen and paper, to understanding what functions, elements, and tags they all play an important part in a site or products creation.
