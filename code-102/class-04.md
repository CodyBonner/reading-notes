## Wireframe and Design

**First things first, what is a wireframe?**

To put it simply wireframing is a practice that's often used by UX designers, allowing them to sort and plan out the hierarchy of information they intend to use to design a website, app, or product for consumer use. It's a way for the designer or in a business sense a client to plan out how they want the end user to view, obtain and process information from the site. Typically this is done after receiving user research from a UX design team.

To elaborate a bit more plainly. If you're creating a website, it'd be pretty important to have an idea of where you want certain information to go and whether or not it comes before or after a specific portion of information. However wireframing is also used to help determine how the end user will use and navigate the website like with button, hyperlink placements, and drop down menu's.

When it comes to developing a website or anything else end user dependent, it's best to take a look at it from the side of the end user. To put it simply, if the end user can't navigate it in black and white on paper, no amount of fancy texts, colors or extra coding on the developer's side will make the website, app or process anymore user friendly.
