# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript

Before we get into it, we first need to understand what JavaScript is, Javascript is a lightweight programming language with first-class functions. While similar to mark down in the sense that it's a web development language, it is widely known as the primary web page scripting language. It's even popular to be used among non-browser environments.

It's dynamic potential includes runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, functional variables, dynamic script creation, object introspection, as well as source recovery.

**What are variables in JavaScript?**

Variables aren't some grand item in coding, they are designated objects that developers(that's you) create to hold information. For example *x=1, y=2, z=3* are all examples of variables. Traditionally though it's common to place the *var* element at the beginning to designate that those characters are variables.

**What does it mean to *declare* a variable**

Declaring a variable occurs when the developer assigns information to the undeclared variable. For example if we simple create *var x=1* we have declared a variable X and given it the value of 1.

**What is an assignment operator and what does it do?**

We've actually seen the assignment operator already in  previous examples. Believe it or not it's not all that exciting, but it's the *=* symbol. In plain text it's a pretty straight forward explanation. It's assigning one thing to another. Example: *x = 1* the assignment operator assigns the value of 1 to the variable x.

**What is information received from the user called?**

Information received from the user is often referred to User input. What this refers to is a function(or segement of code) that when run seeks input from the user. For example a login screen for any website is requesting user input(your user and your password). The most common introduction to this in javascript is using the *prompt* command, it will output a predetermined message to the user and allows the user to input a response to that predetermined message.
