# Wireframe and Design

**First things first, what is a wireframe?**

To put it simply wireframing is a practice that's often used by UX designers, allowing them to sort and plan out the hierarchy of information they intend to use to design a website, app, or product for consumer use. It's a way for the designer or in a business sense a client to plan out how they want the end user to view, obtain and process information from the site. Typically this is done after receiving user research from a UX design team.

To elaborate a bit more plainly. If you're creating a website, it'd be pretty important to have an idea of where you want certain information to go and whether or not it comes before or after a specific portion of information. However wireframing is also used to help determine how the end user will use and navigate the website like with button, hyperlink placements, and drop down menu's.

When it comes to developing a website or anything else end user dependent, it's best to take a look at it from the side of the end user. To put it simply, if the end user can't navigate it in black and white on paper, no amount of fancy texts, colors or extra coding on the developer's side will make the website, app or process anymore user friendly.

## What to consider when wireframing?

The main thing to consider is what does the situation require for this project? Is it going to be more visually dependent? How much uncertainty is there while being respectful to the design? These typically take precedent over simple developer preference to wireframe.

Numer of ways designers move from design to implementation is vast because no two projects will ever be 100% the same and not every designer will do things the same way.

Examples include:

Wireframe -> Interactive prototype -> Visual -> Design

Sketch -> Wireframe -> High Def Wireframe -> Visual -> Code

Sketch -> Wireframe -> Visual -> Code

When it comes to development much like a home no two are exactly the same, there's always a sense of uniqueness and a certain flavor that each designer brings to the table.

Common tools for wireframing include:
 - UXPin

 - InVision
 
 - Wireframe.cc

 - Classic Pen and Paper

 **Things to remember before you start any wireframing project**

 - Do your research: mainly understanding audiance and defining the need and use of what you plan to develop.

 - Prepare your research: it's a best common practice to always have your research on hand, the last thing you need is conflicting products because you or anyone else couldn't remember something.

 - Ensure User Flow is mapped out: What this relates to the flow of the product and how users will use and understand the informaiton given to them.

 - Draft and Sketch before you draw and illustrate: Similar to English class in high school, have a rough draft of what you want to create, going in blindly typically will lead to more mistakes as well as a lot of time wasted.

 - Add detail and test: once you have drafts start practicing what does and doesn't work.

 -Turn wireframes into prototypes: This is where you begin pulling everything together instead of just testing out specific sections on their own, need to make sure it all works together and not just assume it does.

 #### Final notes to remember when it comes to wireframing

 - Clarity: Be clear about what the product will be used for and why it's important.

 - Confidence: Be confident about your work but also make sure the end user will have confidence in using the product such as a website, if the user can't figure it out easily, they'll give up and move on.

 - Simplicity: There's nothing more frustrating than getting too much information too quickly, repetition of information or too many links will confuse end users and ultimately hender their goal of obtaining information and or completing their task.
