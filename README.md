## My View on Growth mindset:
Growth mindset to me means not limiting yourself to what you already believe you can do, it means breaking through your current ceiling
and reaching an even higher level. However that does not mean to only work hard, it also means understanding your current limits 
and making sure to maintain self preserverance to attain proper growth. 

### Things to remember about growth
1. Things to remember when it comes to growth is to remember that when challenged with adversity or self doubt, understand that these things
are normal but they do not have to define who you are. Growing is understanding and shattering those limits and seeing just how far you can go.

2. Remember that just because you've made a mistake or something isn't working out. It does not mean that you have failed. It means that you've just found a way that doesn't work. Congrats on learning that! Now you know what **Not** to do next time!

3. Understand that all of your effort no matter how small is progress. It doesn't mean that you're doing it wrong or failing. It just means that you're taking the time to understand things in your own way and making it work for you. That means your accomplishing it and that's something to be proud of. And as Walt Disney once said:
  
  > **Keep Moving Forward**
