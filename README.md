## My View on Growth mindset:
Growth mindset to me means not limiting yourself to what you already believe you can do, it means breaking through your current ceiling
and reaching an even higher level. However that does not mean to only work hard, it also means understanding your current limits 
and making sure to maintain self preserverance to attain proper growth. 

### Things to remember about growth
Things to remember when it comes to growth is to remember that when challenged with adversity or self doubt, understand that these things
are normal but they do not have to define who you are. Growing is understanding and shattering those limits and seeing just how far you can go.
