            <ul>
              <li>
                Number: These are numerical values such as 1, 2, 3 they are also sometimes referred to as integers.
              </li>

              <li>
                Strings: These are variables that hold a value of a text, such as a list for grocery shopping where we write bread, eggs, milk, cheese, etc.

              </li>

              <li>
                Objects: Such as true/false values like with boolean situations
              </li>

              <li>
                Other Arrays: Yup you got that right, even other arrays can be stored inside an array. This is most commonly used when trying to create tables of information versus just a list.

        <p id = " answer">
          Yes this is a valid array by a coding stance meaning that no errors occur when it is typed out, however the information within it cannot be accessed. The reasoning is because

        <h4>
          List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
        </h4>

        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ' + ' is an operator for adding one value to another.
            </li>

            <li>
                ' - ' is similar to the addition operator it instead subtracts a value from another.
            </li>

            <li>
               ' = ' is the assignment operator it assigns a value to a variable determined by the developer.
            </li>

            <li>
                ' += ' is the operator used for addition assignment, what this means is it will add the corresponding value and reassign the original variable to this new value.
            </li>

            <li>
              ' %= ' is the remainder assigment operator, it takes the remainder of two operands and assigns the remaining value to the left operand.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <section>
        <p id = "evaluation">
          let a = 10;
          let b = 'dog';
          let c = false;

          evaluate (a+c) + b;

          The overall result would be 10dog because there is no conditional reasoning to justify a callback to anything being false or true, so while it may technically add all of the elements above, false is not a value that can be displayed without any form of conditional actions to give true or false.

      <section>
        <h4 id = "realworld">
          Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a javascript program.
        </h4>

        <p id = "realWorldA">
          An obvious answer to this would be based on a user input is where a conditional statement should be used. If the user does X action run X code, else if user does Y instead run Y code instead.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4 id = "loops">
          Give an example of when a loop is useful in javascript.
        </h4>
          <p id = "loopsA">
            Loops are useful for when you want a specific set of code to run until a certain condition is met. For example if a user doesn't input the right password then keep asking for the right password until it's entered correctly or a limit of attempts is reached.
