# Chart.js & Canvas

**What does the canvas allow a developer to achieve?**

In a simple sense, the canvas element allows the developer(that's you)  to draw and create 2D images through Javascript. 

**What is the importance of the closing </canvas> tag?**

The closing canvas tag is vital to the canvas element because in  the unlikely event that the canvas isn't supported by the web browser for whatever reason, the inlined text become the fall back text that will display for the user when the canvas fails.

**Explain what the getContext() method does**

The getContext method is similar to that of the console.log method we've seen and utilized thus far for calling information that we need. The getContext method is a method that returns a render context object. For example if you wanted a 2D render of the content, using this method would showcase the information in a 2D format. 

**What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project**

Chart.js is a library accessible to almost all iteratons of javascript that will create 2D charts based on developer style to display a library of data. It can be integrated into a javascript file by installing it through the npm install chart.js method.

**List 3 different chart types you can create using Chart.js**

There are multiple types of charts that can be created using chart.js but the most common are bar charts, these are often referenced as bar graphs which are often used to help show comparisons of different locations or segments of data, line charts also known as line graphs which usually show changes over periods of time, and Radar chats, these are commonly seen but not often spoken of, you as the user probably saw these in studies indicating where your skills lean towards dependent on answers or habits lean towards based on actions.

**What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?**

A basic answer to this is that displaying data via a chart is preferable because of how easy it is to essentially make a table utilizing the already pre-built in options that chart has to offer. Where with a table we have to create individual elements for each section of data, a chart will take the entirity of the data and compile it into a single element type through chart. It is also pretty handy to use as it allows for multiple styles of chart to be integrated into one another instead of being reduced to a single option like with a table.

**How could chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?**

While they may not have been able to create the same table layout in previous applications. I do believe the same data could have been displayed utilizing a line graph which could showcase store by store data utilizing color along with highs and lows of the stores progress to showcase which store was producing effective results.


## Things I want to know more about.

Are charts difficult to control and manipulate using data?

Are charts restricted to data creation through objects and constructors or can they be created with simple variables and values?
