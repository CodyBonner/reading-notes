# Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

Information regarding Object Oriented programming, and HTML tables, as well as what they are and how to read them.

**Explain why we need domain modeling.**

Domain modeling in an essence is the visualization model of the developers code into something a user can read and understand. The model represents the different attributes as well as how the website acts and functions and yes this also includes it's limitations of what it can and cannot do. 

Something to keep in mind though is that there is a term often used called Object Oriented Model, and what this means is the overall container of the different data, methods and properties that go into the visual representation of the website.

**Why should tables not be used for page layouts?**

The first and foremost reason not to use a table for webpage layout is that the accessibility to data is greatly reduced especially for those visually impaired. Tables also have a habit of creating what is frequently known as *tag soup*, which in lamens terms is there's so many terms that semantic styling for tags and IDs because nill and it's just a big mess of tags that you won't know your right from your left. And lastly these tables are not readily responsive unlike CSS styling for information. Tags like in CSS typically by default respond to 100% of the webpage, where as tables do not, they will only display as big as the content that's added to them.

**List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table.**

The first and most obvious element for an HTML table is *table*, this element is used similarly to the other elements where information is stored inside, this is essentially the container that holds everything related to the table. Second is *td* and this stands for table data, and as obvious as it may sound, it is just that the information that's going into the a cell of the table, such as a string or number. To get multiple rows/columns of information you need multiple lines of the element td to do so. And lastly to stop our table from ever growing to garganchuan sizes, we use the *tr* which stands for table row, and this will effectively put a break in the table so it stops at that cell that comes right before it.
