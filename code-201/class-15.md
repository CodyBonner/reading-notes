# Psychological Safety

**What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?**

Being considerate of each other and everyone's opinion inside a team, no one is better than the other. So everyone should feel welcomed and included. A good understanding of body language and how they spoke, what kind of tone they had at the time will do wanders for team work. Establishing clear goals from the beginning so that way no one feels like they are endlessly working on something that will bare no fruit.

**Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting(or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.**

In a previous employment I was assigned to work under a new General Manager one which I had not built a professional relationship with at the time, and no clear goals or expectations were ever laid out in the beginning. It was simply a sink or swim forced situation resulting in a very toxic teamwork setting that eventually trickled down to other co-workers as well.

**What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?**

In regards to the company they often yield higher results as well as boost moral. In regards to team members, the team understands that they are equally dependent and depended upon by each other to succeed, and they develop a high sense of trust among one another resulting in outstanding work.
