# Javascript Basics

Some basics regarding javascript and how they work.

1. What data type is a sequence of text enclosed inside a single set of quotation marks?

This is known as a string, a string is often seen as such *let string("This is a string")*

2. List four types of JavaScript Operators.

Operators are simply things used to denote actions happening to variables that have been assigned previously, as well as assigning variables themselves. For example, *+*, *-*, *=*, and *+=* are all operators when it comes to actions taken against variables. The most common one used when it comes to JavaScript is the assignment operator also known as the equals(=). This operator will assign a value whether it be a string, or a number to a variable you as the user choose. Like *x = 3* the operator will assign the value of three to x. As well as 3-2 the minus/subtract operator will take 2 from 3.

3. Describe a real world problem you could solve with a function. 

A real world problem I personally could solve using a function would be taking recognizing user acknowledgement or input for a form and giving a check mark next to a task that needs to be done.

#### Review

1. An if statement checks a (function condition) and if it evaluates to (true) then the code block will execute.

2. What is the use of an else if?

The need for an else if statement is typically reserved for a conditional function that needs three or more conditions before executing a specific block of code. For example if(x = y) run this block else if(x = z) run this block else(x ! y | z) run this block of code instead. 

3. List three different types of comparison operators.

There is the typical *==* operator which is a loose equal to operator, such as 3 == "three" they are similar enough that it'd return true. Then there's *===* which is considered the absolute equal operator, using the previous example if we used 3 === "three" it'd return false, while the information may be the same, the value and type of these two don't match one is a number and the other a string so the webpage would return a false result. Then we got the infamous *!=* which indicates does not equal it's often used as a check for information. Such as if we dedicate the value 5 to the variable X and we say in a function if(x!= 7) run block of code. In this instance the script will check to see if X has a value of 7, if it doesn't it runs the code. If it does equal 7 it won't run. 

4. What is the difference between the lgocial operator && and the ||

The difference between these two operators is probably a lot easier than most realize. The first one is the and operator, it's often used for conditional arguments such as x = 12 && 10 though not in that format. It takes into account two conditions and if they both return true then the block of code will run and it's counterpart the || operator otherwise known as or, is a more loose consideration of factors. If one this is like condition one OR is like condition two, run the block of code. They typically come in handy with conditional functions.
