# Basics of HTML, CSS, & JS

A continuation of the introduction to HTML

**Why are semantic elements important to HTML?**

Semantics are important when it comes to HTML because they help determine not only what a set of code is, but it helps determine what exactly they do. For example *p* is a semantic element that defines the use of a paragraph in an area of HTML. There are all kinds of semantic elements as well, there's *body*, *head*, *header*, *main*, *footer*, and so many more. They all play a role when it comes to HTML in making sure the website is concise and functioning.

**How many levels of headings exist with HTML?**

Now this is all relative to what yo define as headings, if we are referring to the very tip top heading known as *head* or *header* then there is only one of each. The head indicates the area in which everything within it's area is run before everything else this section is often used for styles or incorporating external scripts. A header is considered the very tip top of the webpage, the part of the webpage often seen containing a website name or some general information about the page. Now if we refer to the types of headings often used for titling a section of the webpage such as a a body of text often referred to *h1 thru h6* then there is only a total of six headings.

**What are some uses of the *sup* and *sub* elements?**

The element sup defines something commonly seen but not widely known as superscript. It typically transforms the text to be slightly taller than normal lines. It's most commonly seen during footnotes or in URLs like WWW. 

It's counterpart also known as the *sub* or subscript will more often than not appear in the same manner as the sup but in the opposite notation. For example with sup the text will be slightly taller so in this instance, subscript will appear slightly short than normal text. Again it's often seen but not well known by it's term take the chemical composition of most elements. Water for example H2O, more often than not most people will know the subscript of it and have a slightly smaller and shorter 2 in between the H and the O. These are both nifty ways of controlling how text is displayed on a broad spectrum.

**When using *abbr* element. What attribute is needed to provide the full expansion of the term?**

To understand this, we need to know what the element *abbr* stands for. In this instance it may be pretty obvious to some but not so much to others. Abbr is an abrbreviation for the element abbreviation. What it does is provide a hint to users on what the information is containing. Such as HTML standing for Hypertext Markup Language, or NASA for National Aeronautics and Space Administration. However something to keep in mind that to use this we must rememeber to include a full expansion of the term in plain text on it's first useage.

## Things I want to know more about

Are there any limitations to using the abbreviation element? Or can we come up with our own abbreviations?

Can abbreviations be stylized like other bodies of text?

Is there a way to change inline styling to where it's not as bad to use?
