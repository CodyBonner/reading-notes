# MarkDown

**What is Markdown?**

The best way I could describe markdown is that it's a text editor using a specific computer language that makes website creation easy and effective for anyone who wants to learn basics of computer syntax or language learning.

**Why do we use Markdown?**

Markdown has a variety of uses from document creation, writing books, making presentations, but the most common use for MarkDown is the easy creation of websites!

**What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?**

The symbol that is used in Markdown to denote a heading is the '#' symbol, one # will denote header one, ## for header two, ### for header three and so forth.

**How many do you need to create the largest heading?**

The largest heading is done using the first # it will make the heading under the inclination that it'll be used at the beginning of the webpage.

**How many do you need to create the smallest heading?**

The smallest heading varies based on how many headings you have on your webpage. If you have two headings then two '#' symbols will create your smallest heading, however if you have six the max '#' then the sixth heading will be your smallest heading.

**When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?**

For making a text bold the symbol that is required is the star '*' to be more accurate you need two of them on each side of the text you would like to be bold. For italicized text you also need this symbol except you need a space between them such as ' * * ' on either side of the text you need italicized. Or you can use the underscore '_' symbol in the same format, however the star symbol is more commonly preferred.

**How do you create a link with Markdown?**

To generate a link such as a link to a blog or a youtube channel, you first need what we call an inline link what this means is first we write the '[ ]' and inside this bracket is where you can write the name of the link for example '[Youtube Link]' then you would follow it with a set of closed parenthese '()' written such as '[Youtube Link]()' in this parenthese you will put the URL of your link, '[Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com)' Doing this will create a link on your site that says Youtube Link and make it available to be clicked and once clicked it will redirect the viewer to the designated website, in this case https://www.youtube.com

**What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?**
