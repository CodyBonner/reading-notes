**What are four important features to look for in a text editor?**

The first and most important thing to look for in a text editor is do you enjoy using the text editor?

Key Features:
1. Code Completion: While typing this will give suggestions based on what you have typed saving time.
2. Syntax Highlighting: Just as it says, it highlights text making it more noticeable and easier to editÂ 
3. A nice variety of themes: Allows user friendly environment and makes the editor feel more like you.
4. The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when needed: Allows for a variety of plugins to tailor the editor to your specific needs as the writer.
   
**What do the following commands do?**

**pwd**
pwd will display the print working directory that is being used such as /home/UserName

**ls**
ls will display what is in the pre-selected pwd, so in this case what is inside /home/UserName may be a folder labled Projects

**cd**
cd is a command known as **Change Directory**, it will allow you to navigate between directories inside of your pwd

**mkdir**
mkdir will allow the user to create directories or better known as folders inside of the project location.

**touch**
Touch is a command that allows us to interact with and manipulate data within a file. However in this particular instance it will create
blank files

Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

**cd projects**
This line in particular is using the change directory command in a relative sense to move to the projects folder.

**mkdir new-project**
This line is creating a new folder with the naming convention 'new-project'

**touch new-project/newfile.md**
This line is reaching into the folder new-project and creating a markdown file known as newfile.md

**cd ..**
This line is reaching two notches into the directory in a relative sense. No specific directory just two notches in

**ls projects/new-project**
This command is listing out folders that are involved in the directory of projects and it's sub directory new-project.
